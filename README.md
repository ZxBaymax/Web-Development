# Web-Development
This project was created by Edilbert Jaguimit, also known as ZxBaymax, as a means to contribute to my GitHub portfolio and to track my progress in web development. I have always been interested in web development and have been working on developing my skills in this field. I believe that creating projects and sharing them on GitHub is a great way to showcase my abilities and to learn from others in the community. With this project, I aimed to not only improve my technical skills but also to develop my ability to work on a project from start to finish. I am always looking for ways to improve and this project was a great opportunity to do so. I am excited to continue developing my skills and to see where my passion for web development takes me.
